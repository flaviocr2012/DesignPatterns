# DesignPatterns

"Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers. Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development". 

1. Decorator Pattern - Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. 
2. Factory Pattern - In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.
3. Singleton Pattern - This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.
4. Strategy Pattern - In Strategy pattern, we create objects which represent various strategies and a context object whose behavior varies as per its strategy object. The strategy object changes the executing algorithm of the context object.
